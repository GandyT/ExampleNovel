YOU It’s my first day at Kaisei High School. I arrived at my homeroom a few minutes early.

YOU There’s two girls sitting next to me. We were all childhood friends.

YOU On my left is Kasumi.

<SHOW KASUMI.NEUTRAL 2 FADE 1>
<WAIT 1>

YOU Kasumi is the captain of the girls swim team. She’s really strong and could probably beat you in an arm wrestle.

YOU Not only is she really athletic, but she is also really good at academics. 

YOU She always helps me study for our history tests but I always end up flopping… somehow… but that’s just because I'm bad. Not because Kasumi is a bad teacher or anything!

YOU She’s smart, beautiful, and stro… ok nothing, moving on.

<HIDE KASUMI FADE 1>
<SHOW MAYUMI.NEUTRAL 3 FADE 1>

YOU On my right is Mayumi. 

YOU She’s well. She’s just a kid…

YOU She likes to eat a lot of sashimi at the conveyor belt sushi bar. She also likes to read a lot of visual novels (not this one though cause it sucks).

YOU However, she is awful at school. I don’t think she ever studied for tests in middle school and um. Her homework, she does her homework 5 minutes before class starts. But she’s also really cool!

YOU I gave her that hat for her 11th birthday, and she hasn’t taken it off since… which is kind of weird but…

YOU Moving on!
