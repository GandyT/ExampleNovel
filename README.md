# VisualNovelEngine

Custom Visual Novel engine made in Unity (C#)

Comes with a demo visual novel. ( does not come with the music )

To make your own visual novel, replace the demo in the Resource folder.

No updated documentation yet, but the current demo includes all supported features (should be easy to figure out)
